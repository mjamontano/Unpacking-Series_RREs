    <tr><td><b>RRE conversations</b> should happen throughout the year – especially as things change and we learn more as individuals and as a team.

How often did you recognize that you were having (or needed to have) an RRE conversation? What could you have done differently?<br>•	How might your work and team results improve if you had RRE conversations more regularly?<br>•	What RRE conversation(s) should you initiate now?</i></td></tr>

    <tr><td>One exciting thing about individualized RREs is the opportunity to <b>share your ideas</b> for contributing to the team. Doing so helps your supervisor determine who should work on what to achieve the best overall results and enable each team member to <b>self-actualize (comparative advantage).</b><br><br><img src="i5.png"><br><br>Such discussions also allow <b>YOU</b> to explore with your supervisor how you can develop to contribute more.<br><br><img src="i6.png"><br><br><b>Idea for Action:</b><br><br>Talk with your supervisor or team members (if you are a supervisor) about ideas for adjusting RREs to expand contributions.</td></tr>
